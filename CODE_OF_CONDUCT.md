# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
* Focusing on what is best for the overall community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Spammy or low-quality contributions (particularly during Hacktoberfest)
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.

## Hacktoberfest-Specific Guidelines

During Hacktoberfest:

* Quality over quantity - focus on meaningful contributions
* Respect maintainer time - read documentation before asking questions
* Follow contribution guidelines strictly
* Accept feedback gracefully - PRs may be rejected if they don't meet standards
* Spammy PRs will be marked as `invalid` or `spam`

Thank you for helping make thingyValidator a welcoming, inclusive project! üôè
